## Setting the Scene

Creating a truly immersive cyberpunk scene requires more than just adding neon lights. It's about atmosphere. In this prompt, we focus on three key elements:

1.  **Environment**: "Neon Tokyo background, rain" - This establishes the mood immediately.
2.  **Subject**: "Cybernetic samurai, full body shot" - Clear subject definition.
3.  **Technical Specs**: "8k, unreal engine 5 render, cinematic lighting" - These keywords force Midjourney to adopt a high-fidelity, rendered look rather than a digital painting style.

## The Importance of Lighting

Lighting is what separates a flat image from a cinematic one. By specifying **cinematic lighting** and **shallow depth of field**, we create separation between the samurai and the busy background. This mimics the look of high-end cinema lenses (like an 85mm f/1.2).

## Aspect Ratio and Versioning

We are using `--ar 16:9` to give it that movie-still quality. This is essential for storytelling. The `--v 6.0` parameter ensures we are using the latest model capable of better text understanding and texture rendering.
